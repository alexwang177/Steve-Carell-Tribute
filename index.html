        <h2>Here is a recap of his work:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>1991</strong> - The Second City

                    The Chicago comedy troupe — which bred other stars such as Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and Mike Myers — was one of the earliest places Carell started performing. Fun fact: Stephen Colbert (heard of him?) was Carell’s understudy. A fetching video showing vintage Carell as Fabio in The Second City’s revue Are You Now or Have You Ever Been Mellow went viral last year.</li>

            <li><strong>1991</strong> - Curly Sue

                    That same year, Carell made his film debut in the Jim Belushi rom-com Curly Sue with his role as Tesio the waiter. It was a small role, to say the least.</li>
            <li><strong>1996</strong> - The Dana Carvey Show

                    Though the sketch show was short-lived, The Dana Carvey Show could easily be credited as the place where Carell’s comedy career took off. He and Colbert were cast members, lending their voices to The Ambiguously Gay Duo cartoon that later became famous on Saturday Night Live, as well as other sketches, like the waiters nauseated by food:</li>
            <li><strong>2004</strong> - The Legend of Ron Burgundy

                    “I love lamp.’’ With those three words, Carell ensured the legacy of mentally stunted weatherman Brick Tamland, forever quoted by a group of people who were teenagers when Adam McKay’s raucous comedy hit theaters in 2003.</li>
            <li><strong>2006</strong> - The Office

                    Carell could star in movies for another 20 years, but for many, he will always be Dunder Mifflin Regional Manager Michael Scott — the obnoxious, needy, and ultimately lovable boss on The Office. Michael Scott gave fans so many unforgettable and poignantly Michael Scott-y moments over the eight seasons his character was on the show: from hijacking Jim and Pam’s wedding to declaring bankruptcy to gracing us with Prison Mike. This role was indeed one for the ages.
